# HistologyNet: Self-Supervised Segmentation Solver (S4)

HistologyNet is a challenge that aims to transform biomedical image segmentation by leveraging self-supervised learning. Traditional methods of annotating histology images are laborious and expensive. In this challenge, participants are tasked with developing a self-supervised learning model for efficient binary segmentation of histology images, eliminating the need for extensive manual annotation.

## Task
1. Developed  a self-supervised learning model that can segment histology images into meaningful regions without requiring extensive manual annotation.
2. Implemented an appropriate pre-text task to facilitate self-supervised learning.
3. Created a user-friendly webpage that allows users to input histology images and obtain their segmented masks, showcasing the practical utility of the developed models.

## Dataset
Training dataset of histology images, include both labeled and unlabeled images.

## Evaluation
Models is evaluated based on the following metrics:
- Jaccard Index
- Dice Coefficient
